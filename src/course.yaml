      ### About this chapter

      This is the first lesson of Kleros course "How to Build in Web3". It's
      taught by Federico Ast, co-founder and President at the Kleros
      Cooperative.


      In this lesson, you will learn the key concepts of the blockchain
      revolution: why Web3 is a new iteration of the Internet and how it is
      different from Web2, the Internet controlled by the big tech companies of
      Silicon Valley.

      Web3 protocols typically operate as multi-sided platforms connecting
      different types of users. Their growth potential typically depends on
      their ability to create network effects. In this lesson, you will learn
      how to study your market structure and your different user types in order
      to create a network effects strategy.
