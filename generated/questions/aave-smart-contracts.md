- [ ]  The bonus paid to liquidators to encourage the purchase of specified collateral with a health factor equal to one
- [ ]  The bonus paid to liquidators to encourage the purchase of specified collateral with a health factor more than or equal to one
- [x]  The bonus paid to liquidators to encourage the purchase of specified collateral with a health factor less than one

##### What is the maximum borrowing capacity of a particular collateral known as?  

- [ ]  Liquidation Threshold
- [ ]  Liquidity Index
- [x]  Loan To Value
- [ ]  Liquidation Bonus
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Loan To Value is the maximum borrowing capacity of a particular collateral. If a collateral has a Loan to Value of 75%, the user will be allowed to borrow 0.75 ETH of primary currency for every 1 ETH of collateral. The Loan To Value is represented in percentage points and is set per collateral.

##### What do you understand by liquidation threshold?  

- [x]  The amount of a borrow position that must be liquidated because it is undercollateralized
- [ ]  The ratio of total collateral multiplied by the liquidation threshold to borrowed principal
- [ ]  The amount of a borrow position that must be liquidated because it is overcollateralized
- [ ]  The maximum borrowing capacity of a particular collateral
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Liquidation Threshold is the amount of a borrow position that must be liquidated because it is undercollateralized. When a collateral has an 80% liquidation threshold, it signifies that the loan will be liquidated when the debt value equals 80% of the collateral value. The liquidation threshold is defined in percentage points and is specified per collateral.

- [ ]  The ratio of total collateral to liquidation threshold
  
Hint: NoHint

##### Pick the correct option(s).  

- [x]  Many flash loans with varied parameters can now be performed in the same call
- [ ]  Many flash loans with varied parameters can not be performed in the same call
- [x]  You can now do a combination of 'conventional' flash loans that are paid back instantly and flash loans that incur debt
- [ ]  You can not do a combination of 'conventional' flash loans that are paid back instantly and flash loans that incur debt
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Flash loans can now be executed in batches, which means that many flash loans with varied parameters can be performed in the same call. This opens the door to strong new use cases, such as repaying numerous assets and positions with a single flash loan transaction. You can now do a combination of 'conventional' flash loans that are paid back instantly and flash loans that incur debt (i.e. the flash loan is not paid back immediately).
